# Project : LLM-Powered Insurance Triage
•	Project Title: LLM-Powered Claims Risk Triage System
• Problem Statement
	Insurance providers receive thousands of claims daily, many containing unstructured textual descriptions that require manual review to assess risk and detect potential fraud. This process is time-consuming, inconsistent, and prone to human bias. With the increasing complexity of policies and regulatory scrutiny, there is a pressing need for AI systems that can triage claims efficiently, fairly, and transparently.
•	Objective
	To develop a scalable AI system powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) and structured metadata that automates the triage of insurance claims into Low, Medium, or High risk levels. The system will incorporate:
	A fine-tuned transformer model (e.g., RoBERTa or DistilBERT) for claim text classification
	A Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline to ground decisions in policy documents
	Explainable AI (SHAP/LIME) to provide transparency into predictions
	MLOps components for model retraining, monitoring, and governance
	A dashboard for claim reviewers to visualize decisions and rationales
•	Expected Outcomes
	A GitHub repository demonstrating a complete end-to-end claims triage system
	Real-time claim risk scoring with explainable justifications
	Deployment-ready code (e.g., via Docker or Azure ML)
	Streamlit or Gradio dashboard for user interaction
	A repeatable framework that can be extended to other domains (health, legal, finance)
