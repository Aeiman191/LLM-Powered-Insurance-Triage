# 🛡️ LLM-Powered Claims Risk Triage System

## 📌 Project Title
**LLM-Powered Insurance Triage**

---

## 🚨 Problem Statement

Insurance providers handle thousands of claims daily, many of which contain unstructured textual descriptions that require manual review to assess risk and detect potential fraud. This manual process is:

- Time-consuming  
- Inconsistent  
- Prone to human bias  

With increasingly complex policies and tighter regulatory requirements, there's a critical need for AI-powered systems that can triage claims **efficiently**, **fairly**, and **transparently**.

## 🎯 Objective

To develop a **scalable AI system** powered by **Large Language Models (LLMs)** and structured metadata that automates the triage of insurance claims into **Low**, **Medium**, or **High** risk categories.

### Key Features:
- ✅ Fine-tuned transformer model (e.g., **RoBERTa**, **DistilBERT**) for claim text classification  
- ✅ **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** pipeline to ground predictions in policy documents  
- ✅ **Explainable AI (XAI)** using **SHAP** or **LIME** for transparency  
- ✅ **MLOps pipeline** for automated retraining, monitoring, and governance  
- ✅ Interactive **dashboard** (Streamlit/Gradio) for human-in-the-loop decision support

## 🧠 Tech Stack

- `Transformers`: RoBERTa, DistilBERT
- `RAG`: for document-grounded reasoning
- `Explainability`: SHAP, LIME
- `MLOps`: MLflow, DVC, or Azure ML
- `Deployment`: Docker, FastAPI
- `UI`: Streamlit or Gradio

## ✅ Expected Outcomes

- 📁 A complete, open-source GitHub repository with end-to-end implementation  
- ⚡ Real-time risk scoring of insurance claims with **explainable justifications**  
- 🚀 Deployment-ready code (Docker/Azure ML compatible)  
- 📊 Interactive Streamlit/Gradio dashboard for claim reviewers  
- 🔄 A repeatable framework that can be extended to **health**, **legal**, and **finance** domains
